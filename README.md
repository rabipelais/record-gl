[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/rabipelais/record-gl.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/rabipelais/record-gl)  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/record-gl.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/record-gl)

Utilities that ease binding Haskell code to
[OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org)
[GLSL](http://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/) shader programs
through the use of the first-class records provided by Nikita Volkov's
[Record](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/record) package.

This library is a companion to the
[GLUtil](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLUtil),
[linear](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear),
[Record](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/record), and
[OpenGL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/OpenGL) packages, and is based on the
[vinyl-gl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl-gl) package.

Download and install from its [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/record-gl) home with:
`cabal install record-gl`

See the *examples* folder to see the interface in action.

*TODO* put short examples here.
